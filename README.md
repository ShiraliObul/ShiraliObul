### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a quantitative molecular biologist with 8 years of research experience in bio-medicine, bioinformatics, and cancer research with experimental data. While working as a full-time researcher, I became a Data Scientist and developed programming skills in Python, R and machine learning while. I am pursuing Data Science related positions in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries because Iâ€™m passionate to improve human health through effective Biomedical data science.
