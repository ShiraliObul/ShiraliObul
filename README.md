### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a molecular biologist with 8 years of research experience in molecular quantitative biology, bio-statistics, and cancer research. I became a Data Science enthusiast and developed programming skills in Python, R and machine learning while working as a full-time researcher. I am pursuing Data Science related positions in the pharmaceutical and biotech industries because I'm passionate to improve human health through effective Biomedical data science.
